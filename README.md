This repository provides an example of using linear regression for predicting house prices, with a focus on evaluating models using Mean Squared Error (MSE). The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and selection processes to ensure the chosen model minimizes MSE and performs optimally.

Features
- Linear Regression Model: Implements a linear regression model tailored for house price prediction.
- MSE-Centric Evaluation: Emphasizes the use of Mean Squared Error as the primary metric for model evaluation.
- Data Preprocessing: Includes steps for cleaning, normalizing, and preparing the dataset for training.
- Model Selection Techniques: Demonstrates methods such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to select the model with the lowest MSE.
- Real-world Example: Utilizes a realistic dataset of house prices to illustrate practical applications.
